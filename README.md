# Higgs Data Analysis
This project aims to process simulation data like that is similar to that produced at the LHC. Each data file contains simulation data for a Higgs boson of a different mass. 
The program analyses the data and determines the mass of the hidden particle with the same methods that CERN used to prove the existence of the Higgs boson in 2012.

# Navigating the repository
### Program:
- data_analysis.py : This file will perform the necesary data analysis on any data set, as long as it is formatted like the data files included in this project.
### Data:
- Diphotons[A-D].dat : These files contain data generated via Monte Carlo simulations. They all have a hidden Higgs boson. The data_analysis.py program was created to work with these files.
- TenEvents.dat : This file only contains ten simulated events and is meant for testing of the code.
